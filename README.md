# News Corp Australia Front End Challenge Two
This repo contains the files for Challenge Two of the News Corp Australia Coding Challenge.

# Objective
Requirements have changed and the Sport news content needs to be dynamically powered by an external content feed (nca-design-mock-scenario-2.png).

Objective: Using JavaScript convert the Sport module so that it is powered by an external feed of your choice (e.g. RSS or JSON data file).

You may use a library (eg jQuery) but you must write you own code to retrieve and render the content via the data feed.

# Solution
This solution is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and AngularJS. Like Challenge One, BootStrap and Font Awesome has been utilised to assist in responsiveness and other graphical elements of the page. 

An accompanying JSON file titled "Articles" contains an array called "Sports" holding the necessary Sports information required to be displayed on the module. 

The purpose of this is to also demonstrate how this code will run in a real environment where it will need to make a http request for information such as a JSON or a RSS feed. Thus, this code cannot run on your desktop but a live version has been developed and linked below under the heading "Live Demo". This repo mainly contains the source code to view, clone or download for any means.
